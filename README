Tagging in elasticsearch
=============

This is a very basic example of how you can use Elasticsearch to get tag
suggestions for a text using an XML dump of Wikipedia as your corpus. The code
is specialized for the Norwegian Wikipeda, but you can probably change it with
a fairly minimal effort. 

The code is only my personal proof of concept/experimentation so there are a
lot of things that need improvement. 

Installing
-----------
To run this you will need a few components:
 - Elasticsearch (download and extract into the repo. run.sh must be corrected with the correct path to the Elasticsearch executable.)
 - Logstash (download and extract into the repo. run.sh must be corrected with the correct path to the Logstash executable.)
 - Python (2.7)
 - Redis (apt-get install redis-server)
 - dewiki (pip install dewiki)
 - elasticsearch for python (pip install elasticsearch)
 - A dump of the Norwegian Wikipedia collection in XML (download from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/nowiki/latest/. The file I use is called nowiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2. Put the path to the extracted file in settings.py)

Executing
-----------
To run everything you should be able to execute run.sh and then start
get_tags.py.

You can then paste text into the terminal and press Control-D to get a list of
suggested tags.

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have, and I will do my best to
answer.
